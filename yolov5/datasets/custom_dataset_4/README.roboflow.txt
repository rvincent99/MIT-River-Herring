The dataset includes 6085 images.
Fish-fuuB are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.6 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.25 percent of pixels
